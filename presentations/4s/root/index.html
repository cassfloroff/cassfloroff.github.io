                <p>The founder, Sam Triumbari, recognized a need from the food service sector for quality products with economical pricing and good service from an efficient distribution network. He noticed that a lot of business owners are too busy to shop around from all the cash and carry outlets wasting their valuable time looking for products in huge warehouse facilities, standing in long lines to pay, soon after needing to load the heavy products from their cars to their front door.</p>
