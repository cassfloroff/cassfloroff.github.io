The first colour scheme seems very neon. It is more harsh and strong on the eyes.

The second colour scheme is cohesive since they are similar shades of purple. It is familiar and not a big transition for the eyes and mood.

The third colour scheme is my favourite, it resembles candy very much to me. The pastels associate cotton candy and softness.
